$ strings drawing.flag.svg | grep "</tspan" | cut -d '>' -f2 | cut -d '<' -f1 | tr -d '\n' | tr -d ' '


The Linux command you provided processes an SVG file named drawing.flag.svg to extract and format specific text content. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each part of the command does:

strings drawing.flag.svg: This command extracts all the printable strings from the drawing.flag.svg file. The strings utility is typically used to find printable text in binary files, but it can also be used on text files to filter out non-printable characters.

grep "</tspan": This filters the output of the strings command to include only lines that contain the string </tspan. This suggests that the text we are interested in is enclosed within <tspan> tags in the SVG file.

cut -d '>' -f2: This splits each line at the > character and keeps the second field. Since the > character closes an XML tag, this effectively extracts the text content immediately following the opening <tspan> tag.

cut -d '<' -f1: This further processes each line, splitting it at the < character and keeping the first field. This effectively removes any closing tags or other XML elements that might follow the text content within the <tspan> tag.

tr -d '\n': This removes all newline characters from the output, concatenating all extracted text into a single continuous string.

tr -d ' ': This removes all spaces from the output, producing a compact string of text without any spaces.

The goal of the entire command is to extract text from within <tspan> tags in an SVG file, remove all newline characters and spaces, and output a single continuous string.
