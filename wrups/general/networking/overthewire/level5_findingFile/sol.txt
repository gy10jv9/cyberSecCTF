# sample guide:
$ find /path/to/search -type f -size 1033c ! -perm /111 -exec ls -lh {} +

# "/path/to/search" Replace this with the directory you want to search in.
# "-type f" Find files only.
# "-size 1033c" Look for files that are exactly 1033 bytes.
# "! -perm /111" Exclude executable files (files that have any of the executable bits set).
# "-exec ls -lh {} +" List the found files in a human-readable format.

#  Run directly on terminal or create and run the script with .sh extension + use "chmod +x <filename>" to create executable permission (optional).
